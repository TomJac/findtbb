#summary A one-page documentation of how to use FindTBB.cmake.

= Introduction =

This web page contains information about an unofficial version of the FindTBB.cmake script I developed for my own TBB programs.

For more information about CMake and TBB:

  * http://www.cmake.org
  * http://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/

The script eliminates the need to set visual studio build options manually.

The script is used and tested on WinXP. If you use another OS (Vista, Linux, Mac, Sun), please give it a try and contact me for support.

This webpage is updated infrequently- the svn log contains details about bug fixes and updates.

Please send any comments or questions to my email or the issue tracker.

= Obtaining FindTBB.cmake =

The code is available in an svn repository: http://findtbb.googlecode.com/svn/trunk

Either checkout the example project:

{{{
svn co http://findtbb.googlecode.com/svn/trunk FindTBB
}}}

Or link the FindTBB.cmake and related files to an existing repository:

{{{
cd my_repository/CMake
svn propset svn:externals "FindTBB http://findtbb.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/CMake/modules" .
}}}

= Usage =

The script will search for your TBB installation using the environment variables which you should create after installing TBB.

These are namely `TBB_INSTALL_DIR` and `TBB21_INSTALL_DIR` (overrides the former).

Furthermore, you need to set CMake variables `TBB_ARCHITECTURE` and `TBB_COMPILER`. These variables define which version of the TBB library are used and correspond to the path of the lib directory you want to use.<br />
`TBB_ARCHITECTURE` is one of ia32, em64t or itanium<br />
`TBB_COMPILER` is sth. like vc9 or cc3.2.3_libc2.3.2_kernel2.4.21 or cc4.0.1_os10.4.9

The script defines the following CMake variables:

|| `TBB_FOUND` || Is TBB installed and found. ||
|| `TBB_INCLUDE_DIRS` || TBB library headers. ||
|| `TBB_LIBRARIES` || TBB libraries. ||
|| `TBB_DEBUG_LIBRARIES` || TBB libraries with debug symbols. ||

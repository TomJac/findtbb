#summary Short guide to building TBB on Linux from source.

Building Threading Building Blocks from source is easy:
  # Download the source from the 'Download' section of [http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/ the TBB website] (I chose the latest Commercial Aligned Release, which was 3.0 update 5).
  # Un-tar the archive.
  # Build it with your favorite compiler. If you omit the `compiler=icc` parameter to `make` the system's default compiler is used.

mv tbb30_131oss ~/src/

cd ~/src/tbb30_131oss/
